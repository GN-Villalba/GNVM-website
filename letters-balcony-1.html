    <h1>Letter 1: To those of us who teach while doing a PhD</h1>
    <h2>Reflections before the autumn semester begins</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Written somewhere between London and Falmer</p>
    <p>This autumn I’ll be supporting an Econometrics course, and although the semester hasn’t even started yet, I already feel something stirring. A quiet excitement. A sense of purpose. And, of course, the early signs of a spreadsheet-induced identity crisis.</p>

    <p>Let’s be honest: teaching while doing a PhD is a lot. I regularly get lost in Stata outputs and forget how to talk like a human being. But somehow, the idea of walking into a classroom, being present, explaining, interacting, grounds me. Teaching pulls me out of the PhD tunnel and reminds me there’s a world beyond drafts and deadlines.</p>

    <p>It also reminds me of why I’m here in the first place.</p>

    <p>I still remember the first time I entered a classroom as a teaching assistant. I had just finished my undergraduate degree and was holding a whiteboard marker like it was a sword I didn’t quite know how to use. I was excited, yes. But I also felt overwhelmed and unsure of myself. A part of me didn’t feel enough. I wanted to help my students and add real value, but I doubted I could.</p>

    <p>That feeling stayed with me. And it became one of the deepest reasons why I kept studying. I didn’t just want more degrees. I wanted to become the kind of teacher who’s actually ready — present, solid, helpful. The kind of teacher I wish I had when I was on the other side of the classroom.</p>

    <p>That’s why I did a master’s. That’s why I’m doing a PhD. And sometimes, when research feels too heavy or abstract, teaching reminds me why I’m still here. It brings me back to what really matters. It keeps me going.</p>

    <p>Now, as I prepare to support Econometrics, a subject that has never scared me but has always challenged and excited me, I’m reminded of why I fell in love with it in the first place. Yes, it’s hard. Historically intimidating for many. But maybe that’s exactly why I’ve always been drawn to it.</p>

    <blockquote>It doesn’t flatter you. It tests you.</blockquote>

    <p>It demands clarity, structure, precision. And I find something beautiful in that. I don’t approach it with fear, but with respect. And with the hope that I can help others see what I see in it — not a wall, but a door.</p>

    <p>So if you're preparing for your first class, wondering if you're qualified, or thinking about how to balance teaching with, well, everything else — I see you. I feel the chaos too. And I want you to know:</p>

    <blockquote>You don’t need to be perfect to make a difference. Your presence matters. Even when you doubt it. Especially then.</blockquote>
